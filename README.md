# PolyUploader API

This repository contains the backend API used by the [PolyUploader](https://github.com/spel987/PolyUploader) project.

It powers several key features:

## ðŸ“Š Public statistics & telemetry
Collects anonymous telemetry (only host names and upload dates) to generate usage stats, which are available at [p-u.vercel.app/statistics](https://p-u.vercel.app/statistics).

## ðŸ”— Unique shareable links  
Creates and access single shareable links that bundle multiple upload links into one page for easier sharing.

## ðŸš€ Utility endpoints  
Includes endpoints like `/terms` or `/download` for redirections and other small features used across the platform.

This API is deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and the database is provided by [Neon](https://neon.com).
